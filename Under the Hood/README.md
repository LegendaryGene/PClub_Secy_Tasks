# IRIS data set classifier
The provided model is a simple FCC NN model that classifies the IRIS dataset into the particular categories with an accuracy of around 80%. The approach is rather simple and conventional, with each layer consisting of some weights and biases, which are fed forward after being randomly initialised and then updated according to the Gradient Descent Algorithm. The activation function used to produce the predictions is the Sigmoid function. All the code is handwritten, but the code to load the dataset is handeled by sklearn module, but that can be handeled locally on the dataset easily.
